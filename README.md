[Snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net): local file sharing in your browser. Inspired by Apple's Airdrop.

## Snapdrop is now LimeWire
Dear Snapdrop community,
Snapdrop has been acquired by LimeWire, a leading file sharing platform with integrated AI tools. You can continue to share any files between devices, while benefitting from:
* sharing files between devices in the same network
* anonymous up- & downloads
* end-to-end encryption
* up to 40GB storage for free users
* integrated AI tools for signed-up users

Visit [snapdrop.net](https://snapdrop.net) or [limewire.com](https://limewire.com)

The Github repository will stay as-is and you can still go ahead and download and run the classic Snapdrop on your own infrastructure.


##  Classic Snapdrop is built with the following awesome technologies
* Vanilla HTML5 / ES6 / CSS3 frontend
* [WebRTC](http://webrtc.org/) / [WebSockets](http://www.websocket.org/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) backend
* [Progressive Web App](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_App)

You can [host your own instance with Docker](/docs/local-dev.md).

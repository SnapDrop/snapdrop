# Snapdrop 

[Snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net): local file sharing in your browser. Inspired by Apple's Airdrop.


#### Snapdrop is built with the following awesome technologies:
* Vanilla HTML5 / ES6 / CSS3 frontend
* [WebRTC](http://webrtc.org/) / [WebSockets](http://www.websocket.org/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) backend
  - You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
    - `node --version`and get an ouput like: `vx.x.x`
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
* [Progressive Web App](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_App)
